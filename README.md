## üìå Overview
- TeleMedicine is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize healthcare access in rural and underserved areas. With limited infrastructure and availability of medical professionals in such regions, this platform bridges the gap by offering remote doctor consultations, AI-driven preliminary diagnoses, and smart medicine recommendations. 
- Offers:
--Remote doctor consultations via video calls.
--AI-powered preliminary diagnoses using symptom analysis.
--Smart medicine recommendations, including alternatives.
- Integrated with IP cameras, it ensures seamless tracking without manual intervention.
- The platform features a dynamic React.js dashboard, backed by Node.js and Supabase, providing administrators with insightful analytics, attendance logs, and real-time data visualization.
- This project blends machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack web development to solve a real-world problem efficiently and intelligently.

## üöÄ Features
- üß† **AI-Driven**: Uses deep learning for face detection and recognition.
- üéØ **High Accuracy**: Achieves 99%+ accuracy using MTCNN + InceptionResnetV1.
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Performance**: Processes live camera feeds with low latency.
- üìä **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize attendance logs and analytics via a React.js frontend.
- üõ† **Robust Tech Stack**: Node.js backend, Supabase DB, and Scikit-learn for matching embeddings.
- üîê **Secure and Scalable**: Designed for institutions or workplaces with multiple users and IP cameras.

## üîß Installation & Setup

Follow the steps below to clone, install dependencies, and run the project locally. Make sure you have **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Python** installed on your machine.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sayantan-dev1003/AttendanceSystem.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
Once the repository is cloned, change your working directory to the project folder:
```bash
cd AttendanceSystem
```

### 3. **Set Up Frontend**
Navigate to the frontend folder where the React application is located:
```bash
cd frontend
```
Install all necessary dependencies for the frontend:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. **Set Up Backend (Node.js)**
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```
Install all necessary dependencies for the backend:
```bash
npm install
```

### 5. **Run the Backend**
To start the backend server, use nodemon (which automatically restarts the server when code changes):
```bash
nodemon app
```
This will start the Node.js backend on the specified port (usually http://localhost:3000).

### 6. **Set Up Flask Server (AI Model)**
Open another new terminal window and navigate to the flaskserver folder, which contains the Python Flask application used for the AI model:
```bash
cd flaskserver
```
Install the required Python dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all necessary Python packages for running the AI model (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.).

### 7. **Run Flask Server**
To start the Flask server, use the following command:
```bash
python faceRecognition.py
```
This will start the Flask server that handles the face recognition and model predictions.
